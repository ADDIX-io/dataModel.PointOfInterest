Entity: Museum  
==============  
This specification is a **temporal version**. It is automatically generated from the  documented properties described in the schema.json condensed into the file `model.yaml`. A temporary `new_model.yaml` file has been created in every data model to avoid impacting into existing scripts. Thus, the specification will be incomplete as long as the schema.json is not updated to the new format (documenting properties). Once updated the `model.yaml` (`new_model.yaml`) needs to be updated as well (automatically) . Further info in this [link](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/specs/warning_message_new_spec.md). As long as it is a provisional format any [feedback is welcomed in this form](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/) choosing option `Feedback on the new specification`

This entity contains a harmonised geographic description of a museum. It is used in applications that use spatial data and is applicable to Tourism, Cultural, and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT applications. Special thanks to [TURESPAÃ‘A](https://www.tourspain.es/en-us) who provided some examples which inspired the development of this data model.
